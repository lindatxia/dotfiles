### Getting started
Assuming a few things:
- your primary shell is `fish`
- you mainly use macOS
- you leverage GNU Stow to use symlinks and manage your dotfiles
- you are someone named Linda

Then this is a bespoke dotfile, and you're in a recovery scenario - fun!

These dotfiles take heavy inspiration from this [blog post](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles).

```
# At your home dir
git clone git@github.com:lindatxia/dotfiles.git

# Set up symlinks
brew install stow

```
